# 📌 Key Takeaways – 16 May 2025

## DevOops Engineering

Today, I explored more about **DevOps**, focusing on:

- 🔧 Configuring **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions** (`deploy.yml`)
- 📦 Containerizing applications written in **Java** and **Python**
- 🚀 Understanding how DevOps supports the software engineering lifecycle

---

## 🚀 What DevOps Does (My Basic Understanding)

```bash
# Developers write code and unit tests locally,
# then push changes to GitHub/GitLab using Git.
```

🔨 Build
Set up environments needed to run the application.

🧪 Test
QA team verifies that the app works properly before it's released.

📤 Release
Collect user feedback and prepare the app for deployment.
Supports Continuous Integration (CI).

📦 Deploy
Use tools like Docker to run the app in containers.
CI/CD pipelines automate this process.

⚙️ Operate
Use Kubernetes and other tools to manage and scale containerized apps.

📈 Monitor
Maintain and observe the system to catch issues early.

❗ New Challenge Today
I struggled with deploying using Kubernetes.
Still learning how to use kubectl and write the correct yaml deployment files.
